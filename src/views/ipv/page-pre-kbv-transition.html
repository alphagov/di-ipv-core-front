         <p>We'll ask you some security questions that only you should know the answers to. This will help us stop anyone else who might have your details from pretending to be you.</p>

        <p>The questions will be about things like your mobile phone contract, bank account, and any credit cards, loans or mortgages you have.</p>
        
        <p>You'll have 15 minutes to answer these questions.</p>

            <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
            Make sure you answer these questions as accurately as you can. You will not get another chance to answer them if you get them wrong.
